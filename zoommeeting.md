Hello Dr. Muzaale,
 
I had missed the deadline to change this course to audit, and I contacted the school, but they requested that I needed to send them an appeal. I was really struggling a lot in this course since I was dealing with a family member’s sickness during this term, and I didn’t fully get a chance to complete all of the homework assignments. Can you help me figure out a best plan of action, so I can try to pass the course?
 
Best Regards,
Fariha Kazi

Isn’t it too late to change? The school issues deadlines for this kind of thing. 
 
Are you concerned about your grades? Have you submitted your homework’s?

Hello Dr. Muzaale,
 
I would like to audit this term, but I don't know how to change my status. Is it possible for you to do it on your end?

Hi Fariha, you're welcome to audit. But in which term? The Spring term ends this Friday!
